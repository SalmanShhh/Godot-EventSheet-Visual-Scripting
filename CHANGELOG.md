# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Workspace shell improvements (issue #59 – slice 2)
- **Toolbar flush at top**: Removed the 8px outer margin that wrapped the toolbar.
  The toolbar now spans the full workspace width with zero margin above or beside it,
  matching the Godot Script editor layout rather than a dock widget.
- **Status bar at bottom**: Added a full-width `PanelContainer` status bar at the very
  bottom of the workspace (thin, 1 px top border). All operation feedback messages
  (save, compile, add/delete events/variables/groups) are now routed here via the new
  `_set_status()` helper rather than appearing in the toolbar header row.
- **Save / Save As**: Added `Save` and `Save As…` buttons to the toolbar action strip.
  - `Save` writes the current sheet to its existing resource path; falls back to Save As
    for unsaved in-memory sheets.
  - `Save As…` opens a FileDialog to pick a path; updates `resource_path` on success via
    `take_over_path()`.
  - Both are disabled when no sheet is loaded.
  - Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+S` (Save), `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Save As).
- **Dirty state tracking**: `EventSheetEditor._is_dirty` is set by `_mark_dirty()` on
  every mutation (add/replace/delete events, conditions, actions, variables, groups,
  condition inversion) and cleared by `_clear_dirty()` on sheet load or successful save.
- **Dirty indicator (●)**: Amber dot `●` appears next to the sheet name in the toolbar
  top row when `_is_dirty` is true; hidden when the sheet is clean.  Controlled via the
  new `SheetToolbar.set_dirty(dirty: bool)` method.
- **Toolbar label rename**: Toolbar header label changed from `EventForge` to `EventSheet`
  to correctly identify the workspace type rather than the plugin brand.
- **Toolbar corner radius**: Set to 0 (flush top) to match the full-width flush-at-top
  layout; previously used a 6 px all-around radius that implied a floated card widget.
- **Tests**: New `tests/workspace_shell_test.gd` covers toolbar save signals, dirty
  indicator visibility, Save/SaveAs button enabled state, and `_mark_dirty` / `_clear_dirty` toggling.
- **Docs**: Updated `docs/EDITOR-UI-SPEC.md` section 2.4 to document the new shell
  structure, toolbar layout, save flow, dirty tracking, and keyboard shortcuts.
